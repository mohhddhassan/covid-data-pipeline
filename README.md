# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Pipeline

Hey! I'm Mohamed Hussain — currently working as an **Associate Data Engineer Intern** 👨‍💻  
This repo is my attempt at building a **simple yet complete data pipeline** from scratch — just to learn how the real thing works!

If you're learning data engineering and wondering how to wire up Airflow + Docker + PostgreSQL, this project might help 🎯

---

## 📁 Project Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `airflow-docker/dags/` | Airflow DAG that fetches data daily |
| `airflow-docker/scripts/` | Python logic to fetch & store COVID-19 data |
| `airflow-docker/plugins/` | (Optional) Custom plugins if needed |
| `airflow-docker/logs/` | Logs generated by Airflow |
| `airflow-docker/docker-compose.yaml` | Docker setup to spin everything up |
| `screenshots/` | Proof of work: DAG, logs, Postgres output |
| `README.md` | You're reading it! |

---

## 🚀 What This Does

- Pulls daily global COVID-19 stats from a public API (`disease.sh`)
- Uses **Airflow** to schedule the job (runs every day)
- Stores the results in a **PostgreSQL** table
- Containerized using **Docker** (so it runs anywhere!)

---

## 🎯 Why I Did This

- Understand what a data pipeline actually looks like  
- Get hands-on with **Airflow**, **Docker**, and **PostgreSQL**  
- Learn how tasks run, fail, retry, and get logged  
- Just build something real ✨

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- How to schedule Python jobs using Airflow
- How to connect Python to PostgreSQL and insert data
- How Docker simplifies the whole stack
- How to structure a small but real project

---

## 🔧 What's Next?

* Add deduplication logic to avoid inserting same data daily
* Maybe build a small Streamlit dashboard (still thinking 😄)
* Play with sensors and templates in Airflow
* **Extend the pipeline with ClickHouse** to explore OLAP-style analytics ⚡

## 🙌 Thanks To

- [disease.sh](https://disease.sh/) for the COVID-19 API  
- Apache docs & community for Airflow + Docker base
